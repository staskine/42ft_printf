# 42ft_printf
My second project for the 42 school curriculum. I'm making a simplified version of printf.

# What I learned
This project was a great opportunity to learn about variadic functions which were interesting. Also unlike the first project, ft_printf was just one big function and it was nice being able to focus on a bigger picture. 
This project also helped me learn about different types of types in C like characters, integers, unsigned integers, pointers, hexadecimals etc and how to work with them. 

I also used structs in my project and though I didn't use them to their fullest extent, it was a good first crash course on them. 

# How to use my ft_printf
Everything needed is found from this repository.
- Just compile my ft_printf using the Makefile using the command 'make'
- Use the header #include "ft_printf.h"
- Use ft_printf the same as a normal printf

ft_printf("This is an example");

char string [] = "Another example";

ft_printf("%s", string);

etc.
